I'm passionate about researching, writing and sharing news and general interest content that helps people to improve, that informs and motivates them to take action, and that uplifts, connects and inspires them. 







I'm based in beautiful Cape Town, but thanks to the web I have an exciting network of contacts around the world, which I leverage to create informative, useful and insightful articles that add value to readers, and brings awareness and authority to my client's sites. 






Over the course of my career I have written news, curated web content, created marketing materials, investigated trends, interviewed celebrities, sourced photography, provided career advice, directed videos, consulted with industry experts, managed a team of writers and worked across a variety of platforms, including print and digital to produce top text, video and image content that appeals to readers everywhere.




I have worked with South African brands that include W24, Liberty, Parent24, Business Insider, Food24, Shoprite, Careers24, Makro, Who’s Who and more, as well as international brands such as Dorothy Perkins, Churchill, Egg Banking, FreelancerZA and Royal Caribbean, to create digital content that attracts and retains customers.




As such I have experience with content marketing in many forms across a variety of industries, from copywriting for SEO purposes to newsletters for customer retention to social media campaigns for brand awareness, and every other possible combination, all with a proven record of success.




Get in touch with me to discuss how I can use my skills to further your business and content marketing goals.
