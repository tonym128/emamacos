US-based meal-kit provider<a href="https://www.blueapron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Blue Apron</a> – which is listed on the NYSE and accounts for over 70% of the US market – has recently taken quite a knock. After testing out meal kits online, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17081466/walmart-meal-kit-in-store-blue-apron-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart announced</a> it will begin selling prepared meals in stores and as a result, Blue Apron stock dropped by 15%.

This activity prompted me to ask: In South Africa, are dinner kit delivery businesses actually on the way out, or are they on the way up?
