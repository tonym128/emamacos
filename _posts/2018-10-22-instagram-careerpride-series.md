From November 2015 to March 2018 my team and I curated a popular Instagram account showcasing local professionals in their daily jobs.&nbsp;

We featured people from all walks of life, conducting interviews and arranging photoshoots with them to create a three-image series on Instagram and an article posted on Careers24.&nbsp;
