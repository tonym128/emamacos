As Employer Brand Editor on this project, I collected, edited and curated content in the form of images, videos and text to create a Company Showcase for Makro that best represented their employee value proposition.

For the videos, I formulated a targeted questionnaire and interviewed the selected participants from behind the camera, on site in Johannesburg, before advising the videographer as to which snippets to use to create each video in line with the selected message.

In total, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=careers24+makro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four videos</a> where created for Makro and included in their Company Showcase on Careers24.
